[0.101s] [33mCMake Warning (dev) at /opt/ros/humble/share/ament_cmake_core/cmake/core/list_append_unique.cmake:30 (if):
[0.101s]   Policy CMP0057 is not set: Support new IN_LIST if() operator.  Run "cmake
[0.101s]   --help-policy CMP0057" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
[0.101s]   set the policy and suppress this warning.
[0.101s] 
[0.101s]   IN_LIST will be interpreted as an operator when the policy is set to NEW.
[0.101s]   Since the policy is not set the OLD behavior will be used.
